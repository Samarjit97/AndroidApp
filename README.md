# AndroidApp

 The app is designed for the local denizens of Horsens, mostly for the pedestrian, it will he help people ride from place to another very easily. The idea is that Iâ€™m going to design the electrical scooter renting app, which will facilitate people to book the scooter from certain locations with specific date and time, the app will also include the station point from where people can get the bicycle, including from arrival to destination point.
